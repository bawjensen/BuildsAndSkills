## Concepts, Plans and Intent

+ Easy to use
+ Fast
+ Everything visible on one screen

## Concerns

+ Sometimes difficult to find non-popular builds
  + Possibly allow filtering by role (supp, adc, mid, etc.)
    + Raises issue of discerning between adc and supp
      + Check final build items for things like IE, etc.
+ Hard to determine popularity of build
  + Probuilds show minimal, but all stacked on each other
    + Possibly highlight similar items on mouse over
